# CT_PDS

This is a platform solution to design PDS with ST's Stm32f429 from CT.

This is my first time to use the CANOpen and LWip protocols. First, I have to know about their source documents. Secondly, it is not easy to Porte protocols from Internet. Secondly, I must use lots of tools to verify functions after compile the project. All of these cost me most of time in this project.

The control logic is not complex, even it may be considered very easy. In my opinion, any project that contains CANOpen or LWip protocaol can be adaptation in future.
